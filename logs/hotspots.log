Was Berlin Pond birded this week, this year: Yes.

How does this script work? It uses a list of all of the Hotspots in Montpelier and checks to see what dates they 
were all birded, by checking the eBird API. Coverage shows the percent of weeks which have had checklists submi-
tted on them, meaning that if a hotspot has had checklists in any year in all 52 weeks, it is at 100%.
